# UCL GIS MSc 2017-18

This repository contains some of the coursework submitted for the UCL GIS MSc.

## TERM 1

### GEOGG0125 - GIS Principles of Spatial Analysis

This module focused on understanding the principles underlying spatial phenomena and learning R to examine and analyse spatial data.

* Coursework 1 - Understanding London using Open Data ([r code](https://github.com/nicolacritten/ucl_gis_msc/blob/master/GEOGG0125/Green%20space%20and%20Anxiety%20in%20London.R), [pdf](/pdfs/SpatialDataAnalysisMM.pdf))

This report analyses the spatial distribution of anxiety levels and access to green space throughout the boroughs of London and then provides an initial exploration into whether there is a relationship between the two.

* Coursework 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis ([r code](https://github.com/nicolacritten/ucl_gis_msc/blob/master/GEOGG0125/LondonHousePrices.R), [pdf](/pdfs/SpatialDataAnalysisNB.pdf))

This report aims to explore and model the spatial distribution of house prices across London and comment on the disparity between boroughs. Then to combine the house price results with household income data to see if there is a correlation.

### CEGEG082 - GIS Principles and Technology

This module provided an overview into the principles and techniques used in the analysis of spatial data. It involved learning Python, which was used in the coursework to solve a point-in-polygon algorithm.

* Coursework - Point in Polygon Python Assignment. The image below shows the output generated from the code. ([python code](https://github.com/nicolacritten/ucl_gis_msc/blob/master/CEGEG082/PIP.py))

This assignment involved writing a Python program to determine whether any given point lies inside or outside a polygon using a ray casting algorithm. It can be used to load a polygon and points from a list of coordinates in any given CSV file.

### CEGEG0126 - Representations, Structures, and Algorithms

This module explored the data models, data structures and algorithms that are fundamental to GISs and methods of spatial analysis.

* Coursework - The assessment of a GIS algorithm used within two published academic papers, followed by, the comparison and testing of two GIS algorithms using QGIS and ArcMap software ([pdf](/pdfs/Algorithms.pdf))

This piece of coursework aims to provide insight into the way algorithms are carried out using different GIS software packages and identity any exception cases where the algorithms may fail. In this case, the implementation of the buffer and centroid tools in QGIS and ArcGIS were considered.

### CEGEG034 - Mapping Science

This module covered many concepts and techniques that are fundamental to all aspects of geomatics, such as satellite systems, coordinate systems, cartography, and metadata.

* Coursework 1 - This was based on the manual geoferencing of a satellite image to a reference map from Ordnance Survey.

* Coursework 2 - The aim of this assignment was to use LiDAR data to determine and assess potential areas flooded by the River Arun under a range of flood scenarios.

## TERM 2

### CEGEG129 - Spatial Databases

This module covered the technical and procedural aspects of the management of heterogeneous spatial data, with a specific focus on the management of large (‘big’) spatial datasets.

* Coursework 1 - The first assignment of this module involved selecting a topic for the database system to be created around. This topic is then described and a fully documented conceptual UML E-R diagram was created. ([pdf](https://github.com/nicolacritten/ucl_gis_msc/blob/master/pdfs/SpatialDatabases1.pdf))

* Coursework 2 - The second assignment built upon the first assignment and involved designing the system described in the first assignment. Additionally, a short essay assessing the capabilities of NoSQL databases was written. ([sql code](https://github.com/nicolacritten/ucl_gis_msc/blob/master/CEGEG129/SQL-SCRIPTS.sql), [pdf](https://github.com/nicolacritten/ucl_gis_msc/blob/master/pdfs/SpatialDatabases2.pdf))

### CEGEG075 - Image Understanding

This module explored advanced image understanding techniques and how these can be applied to satellite, aerial and laser scanned imagery. 

* Coursework - This focused on using the appropriate image understanding methods to solve a real-world problem. In this case, OpenCV and Numpy tools were used to extract reservoirs from a group of satellite images. The image below shows the output generated from the code when extracting the outline of Lake Mead from three satellite images taken in 2016 (blue), 2002 (green) and 1984 (red) layered over the image of Lake Mead from 2016. ([python code](https://github.com/nicolacritten/ucl_gis_msc/blob/master/CEGEG075/ReservoirExtraction.py), [pdf](/pdfs/ImageUnderstanding.pdf))

### CEGEG077 - Web and Mobile GIS - Apps and Programming

This modules covered the aspects of Web and Mobile GIS with a very strong focus on programming for the web and programming for mobile phones, using platform independent deployment methods such as phone-gap.

* Coursework - The coursework involved creating a fully documented, working Web / Mobile GIS application which contains a web component, a mobile component and a linking database to demonstrate understanding of the three-tier architecture. This was created within three repositories in a different github account. These repositories represent the three components of the application: the [mobile application](https://github.com/nikscrits/quiz), the [web application](https://github.com/nikscrits/questions), and the [server](https://github.com/nikscrits/server). The final pdf for the technical guide can be found [here](https://github.com/nicolacritten/ucl_gis_msc/blob/master/pdfs/WebandMob.pdf).

### GEOGG152 - Network and Locational Analysis
